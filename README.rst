What is BrownBat ?
--------------------------------

**BrownBat** is a pure Python library to create source code generators.
Its main features are:
 * Laziness everywhere: you can set every possible name or attribute after the object has been created and used, and 
   it will be taken into account when printed
   
 * Nifty operator overloading, making it quite easy to manipulate source code objects
 
It currently handles C langage, but adding new langages leveraging all the facilities given by the core should be easy.

**BrownBat** requires Python 3 to work correctly.
It can be installed from PyPI (Python package index)::
